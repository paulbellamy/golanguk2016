* 

: Goal: After this talk you'll be able to say "That's not advanced, that's obvious!"

: There will be quite a lot of code
: We'll go through stuff fairly quick

: not this kind of readers.

* What's available in io, bufio, & ioutil?

: Simply put? Building blocks, and great examples

* What's available in io, bufio, & ioutil?

: ReadWriter is one of the most powerful abstractions available in Go.
: Simple, Expressive,Composable, Interchangeable
: Loads more in standard library

  type ReadWriter interface {
        Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
        Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
  }

Tools for working with ReadWriters:

- io.Copy
- io.LimitReader
- io.TeeReader
- bufio.Scanner
- ioutil.Discard

Loads more!

* Composition

: Building our own abstractions around Readers is really easy
: And composing them
: Can be interchanged

* Composition

: LimitedReader limits the amount of data returned to N bytes.
: After N bytes have been read, it returns io.EOF, the signal for "no more data"

: LimitReader source is very readable
: Wraps our number stream, Still fulfills same interface

: io.Copy Backwards

.code limit.go /START SETUP OMIT/,/END SETUP OMIT/

.code limit.go /START OUTPUT OMIT/,/END OUTPUT OMIT/

* Composition

: Seamlessly gzipped output

.code limit.go /START SETUP OMIT/,/END SETUP OMIT/

.code limit.go /START GZIP OMIT/,/END GZIP OMIT/

* Example 1 - HTTP Chunking

* Example 1 - HTTP Chunking

Let's transparently proxy a chunked HTTP in a stream.

: What does transparently mean?
: What does HTTP chunked encoding look like?

* Example 1 - HTTP Chunking

: Body is the interesting part here.
: Each chunk has a hex length, then carriage-return-linefeed
: E chunk is 14 characters long.
: Body ends with 0-length chunk
: Note the two trailers, Date, and Content-MD5
: Like headers, but *after* the body
: We want to verbatim forward the body
: We want to process the Trailers
: To verify the md5

Encoded:

  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Decoded Body:

  chunks.

* Example 1 - HTTP Chunking

: Client should not care about how data is chunked
: Some expect json objects to align

Why?

* Solution 1

Obvious solution with io.Copy

.image chunking1.svg

.code chunking1.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

* Solution 1

Obvious solution with io.Copy

.image chunking1.svg

.code chunking1.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Problems:

- Won't let us process the Trailers separately
- We need to stop after the body

* Solution 2

: Dig around in httputil, and find httputil.ChunkedReader

Better solution with httputil.ChunkedReader

.image chunking2.svg

.code chunking2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: Is great, and probably good enough for most of the time
: But, has some issues

* Solution 2

: Problems:
: Turns it into one continuous byte-stream
: Breaks the transparency of our proxy.

Better solution with httputil.ChunkedReader

Problems:

- Strips out the chunking data

  chunks.

- Can't validate the MD5

* Solution 3

: Every read from TeeReader writes the raw data to clientWriter, ChunkedReader to detect the end of the body
: Like a transistor
: 1. Could we implement this in a single reader? Yes
: 2. Would that be more performant, or less? Depends on number of copies

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: Something a bit lighter

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: Running a bunch of subcommands
: Multiplexing the streaming output

Run subcommands, multiplex the output, give each a unique prefix.

Commands:

  echo "Hello,\nWorld!"
  make all
  git status

Output:

  [echo] Hello,
  [make] make: *** No rule to make target `all'.  Stop.
  [echo] World!
  [git] On branch master
  [git] Your branch is up-to-date with 'upstream/master'.
  [git] nothing to commit, working tree clean

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

.image prefix.svg

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: Take list of commands
: Set up each one
: Create prefixingWriter for each (We'll implement that)
: Run them async

Starting up the commands

.code prefix.go /START USAGE OMIT/,/END USAGE OMIT/

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: Type signature

: Takes a prefix, and an output source
: Returns a new writer
: Any data written to this will have prefix on each line

Prefixing Writer

.code prefix.go /START DECL OMIT/,/END DECL OMIT/

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: A scanner turns streams of bytes into streams of tokens
: Default is split by line, others are utf-8 runes, words, or custom.
: This lets us iterate over the lines in a reader
: mention Fscanf
: Let's look at input to see how it connects 

Splitting streams into sections with bufio.Scanner

  func prefixingWriter(prefix string, output io.Writer) io.Writer {
    input := ...

    // Iterate over each line
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(input)
    scanner.SplitFunc(bufio.ScanLines)

    for scanner.Scan() {

      // Write the prefix into the output
      fmt.Fprintf(output, "[%s] ", prefix)

      // Copy the line
      output.Write(scanner.Bytes())

      // Re-add a newline (scanner removes it)
      fmt.Fprint(output, "\n")

    }

    return input
  }

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: Input needs to connect a Writer to a Reader

What is `input` ?

- bufio.Scanner expects a io.Reader
- exec.Cmd expects a io.Writer

* Example 2 - Multiplexing Subcommands

: io.Pipe two synchronous halves, similar to a chan
: Pipe to connect the reader and writer, Scanner to tokenize into lines, Goroutine prefixing and merging
: 1. Could this leak goroutines? Yes, if output blocks indefinitely
: 2. How could we avoid leaking goroutines? Avoid using a goroutine. Use a WriteCloser, to guarantee cleanup
: 3. What if we wanted to save the output until the process exited? bytes.Buffer

io.Pipe to the rescue
